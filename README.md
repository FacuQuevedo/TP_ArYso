# Welcome to the team! 
Let’s give you a quick introduction to the teamwork: Facundo Quevedo, Santino Capone, Nerina Coronel, Agustín Andrenacci and Mirko Lonac. We’re all programming technicians from the city of Rosario and sorroundings.
Before to start working with the project, you have to be sure to accomplish the following requirements:
    • Have Ubuntu or Linux as operating system or a virtual machine to run any of those OS.
    • Have Docker and Docker-compose installed

after you finish installing everything, you can start working with the image we created. 
- if you download the files. the first command you have to do is a docker-compose up --build -d
- after that you can start working with the image.




also you can work with the image.
- docker pull docker pull facundoquevedo1/grupo2_tp:latest
- then all have to do is a docker run.
